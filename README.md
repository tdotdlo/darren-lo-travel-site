# Learning Outcomes

I tried to markup the webpage schemantically before applying any styles to see if it would help my thought process when creating the skeleton of the page. I found that it helped me visualize and understand where I would need to have sections as well as div's for certain parts of the project.

I found it very beneficial to predetermine layout. I will probably be attacking other projects like this moving forward. I realized there were some portions of the website which I thought I would have to re-markup again because I wasn't sure if the styling would work. I had to refactor code several times to make minor adjustments since the mockup did not give specific dimensions which made this website a bit more challenging.

## New Style Properties Learned

### :first-child

- used to target the company information card in the footer to set the flex-basis.

### :last-child

- used to target the social media card in the footer to adjust the spacing between the images

### column-gap

- used to adjust the spacing between the recommendation cards on the landing page. The style properties were not achieving something similar to the style guide.

### :focus

- used to target the input fields on the contact form.
